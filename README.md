# Simple-Weather-App
A user-friendly app that allows you to check the current temperature in any city.

* Enter the name of a city, and the app will retrieve the corresponding latitude and longitude using the Google Maps Geocoding API.
* The app then uses the MET Weather API to fetch and display the current temperature for that location.

# TODO
* Add your API key in GoogleGeocodingAPIkey.kt to enable location lookup.
